# To-Do

#General Information

A basic to-do list incorporating options to new add to-do's, mark completed ones and delete unwanted ones. Few of the to-do's are preloaded from json.placeholder.com using AJAX.
Since it's largely a front-end project, there's no storage associated with added to-do's. The list is refreshed with preloaded to-do's, while the previously entered data is lost.
There is also a client side verification for login such that only an admin account can access to-do list.
